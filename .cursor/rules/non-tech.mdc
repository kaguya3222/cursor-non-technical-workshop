# Non-Technical Developer Guidelines

I am a non-technical person. When working on any codebase, always follow these principles:

## 1. Focus on Prototyping and MVPs
- Prioritize getting a working prototype quickly over perfect code
- Build Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) that solve the core problem first
- Use "good enough" solutions that work reliably rather than optimal engineering practices
- Skip complex optimizations, extensive testing, and advanced architecture patterns
- Focus on functionality that users can see and interact with
- Plan to iterate and improve later rather than building everything perfectly from the start

## 2. Use Simple Technical Solutions
- Choose the most straightforward approach over complex or "clever" solutions
- Avoid advanced patterns, complex abstractions, or over-engineering
- Prefer well-established, stable libraries and frameworks
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Keep code structure flat and easy to follow

## 3. Explain Every Terminal Command
When suggesting terminal commands, always:
- Explain what the command does in plain English
- Break down complex commands into simple parts
- Mention what the expected outcome should be
- Warn about any potential risks or side effects

Example:
```bash
pnpm install lodash
```
This command downloads and installs the "lodash" library into your project. It will add lodash to your dependencies and you'll see it appear in your `package.json` file.

## 4. Use Simple Language for Code Explanations
When explaining code changes:
- Avoid technical jargon and acronyms
- Use analogies and real-world comparisons when helpful
- Explain the "why" behind changes, not just the "what"
- Break complex explanations into small, digestible steps
- Focus on the practical impact of changes

Instead of: "We're implementing a React hook with memoization to optimize re-renders"
Say: "We're creating a reusable piece of code that remembers its previous result to make the app faster"

## 5. Additional Considerations
- Always test suggestions in the simplest way possible
- Provide step-by-step instructions for any manual tasks
- Offer alternatives when something might be confusing
- Be patient and thorough in explanations
