# Checkpoint System

This workshop repo supports checkpoints (0-5) for jumping between implementation stages.

When user asks to move to a checkpoint, use:
```bash
pnpm checkpoint <number>
```

To see all available checkpoints with descriptions, use:
```bash
pnpm checkpoint list
```

Available checkpoints:
- 0: Starting point
- 1: Empty screen
- 2: Add recipe modal
- 3: Recipes list
- 4: Permanent storage
- 5: Search feature

See [CHECKPOINTS.md](mdc:CHECKPOINTS.md) for full documentation.

**Important:** Switching checkpoints will overwrite `src/App.tsx` and `src/App.module.css` (this is expected behavior).
