If you are on Windows, before running Node.js/pnpm commands, ALWAYS make sure to run $env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine")

Concat them with commands you planned to run.

<example>
If you wanted to run "node -v" make it as "$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine"); node -v"
</example>

MAKE SURE YOU APPLY IT ONLY FOR NODE.js/PNPM commands
