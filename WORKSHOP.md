## ‚öôÔ∏è Stage 3: Run Your Project

**Concept**: Let Cursor help you set up and run the application

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
The project needs some software packages installed to run. Instead of figuring this out yourself, let the AI help!

Type in chat: "Install everything needed to run this project and run it @README.md"

The AI will run terminal commands for you. Don't worry - this is expected and normal!

**What's happening**: The AI is installing "dependencies" - think of them as building blocks your app needs to work.

### Step 2: Start the Application
Type: "Run the project"

The AI will start a development server, and you should see a message about opening your browser to a local address (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

### Step 3: View Your App
Open your browser and go to the address shown. You should see a basic version of FlavorFlow!

### üéâ Checkpoint!
Share your result in FigJam!

## ü™ü Stage 4: Unlock Agentic Window

**Concept**: Switch to a simpler, more conversational interface

Since we're not engineers, we don't need all the technical IDE features. Cursor has a special "Agentic Window" that gives us a cleaner, chat-focused experience.

### Enable Agentic Window
1. Open **Cursor Settings**
2. Go to **Beta** section
3. Enable **Agent Window**

### Open Agentic Window
- Look for the Agent Window icon in the top-right corner of the chat
- Or press `Cmd + E` (Mac) or `Ctrl + E` (Windows)

This gives you a focused view perfect for working with AI!

## üé® Stage 5: Build Your First Screen

**Concept**: Turn designs into reality through "vibe coding" with AI

Now the fun begins! We're going to build FlavorFlow - a beautiful app for saving food recipes!

### Step 1: Study the Design
1. Open the Figma design (link from prerequisites)
2. Look at the main screen that shows when there are no recipes yet
3. Notice the layout, colors, and components

### Step 2: Take a Screenshot
Take a screenshot of the empty state screen from Figma

### Step 3: Generate the Code
1. Make sure you're in **Agent** mode
2. Select **Claude Sonnet** model
3. Upload your screenshot to the chat
4. Write a prompt like:

```
Please implement this screen for FlavorFlow. This is the empty state 
when the user hasn't added any recipes yet. Match the design in the 
screenshot.
```

5. Press Enter and watch the magic happen!

### Step 4: Iterate and Improve
The first result probably won't be perfect - **that's totally normal!** 

Keep refining with prompts like:
- "Make the spacing between elements larger"
- "Change the button color to match the design better"
- "Center the content on the page"
- "Make the text bigger"

**Pro tip**: Be specific about what you want changed!

### üéâ Checkpoint!
Share your result in FigJam!

## üé≠ Stage 6: Build the Add Recipe Modal

**Concept**: Use advanced tools like Figma MCP and Playwright MCP

Now let's add the modal (popup window) where users can add new recipes!

### Option A: Using Figma MCP

Figma MCP is a special connection that lets Cursor read designs directly from Figma! **This option is available for people who have a paid Figma seat.**

### Step 1: Enable Figma MCP
1. Open **Cursor Settings** ‚Üí **MCP** section
2. Find **Figma MCP**
3. Click **Authorize** and sign in to Figma
4. Make sure it's enabled

### Step 2: Get the Design Link
1. In Figma, activate **Dev Mode** (if not already active)
2. Select the modal design
3. Right-click ‚Üí **Copy link to selection**

### Step 3: Prompt the Agent
Type something like:

```
Using Figma MCP, implement this modal: [paste your Figma link]

This modal should allow users to add a new recipe with fields for 
the recipe name, category, and any other details.
```

**üìñ More details**: https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/remote-server-installation/#using-the-mcp-server

### Option B: Using a Screenshot
If you don't have a paid Figma seat, just take a screenshot like before and upload it with your prompt!

### Step 4: Iterate on the Modal UI
Refine the modal's appearance:
- "Make the input fields larger"
- "Add more spacing between the form fields"
- "Make the submit button more prominent"

### Step 5: Debug with Playwright MCP

After adding recipes, you might notice they disappear when you refresh the page. Let's fix this!

#### Enable Playwright MCP
1. Open **Cursor Settings** ‚Üí **MCP** section
2. Find **Playwright MCP**
3. Make sure it's enabled

#### Use It to Debug
Type:

```
Use Playwright MCP to test adding a recipe and refreshing the page. 
Help me understand why recipes aren't being saved and fix it so they 
persist after page refresh.
```

The AI will run the browser and test your app automatically, suggesting solutions after!

### üéâ Checkpoint!
Share your working modal in FigJam!

## üìö Stage 7: Build the Recipes List

**Concept**: Display saved recipes in a beautiful list

Now that users can add recipes, let's show them in a nice list!

### Step 1: Get the Design
Use either:
- Figma MCP with the recipes list selection link, OR
- A screenshot of the recipes list design

### Step 2: Prompt the Agent
```
Implement what's shown on the screen. Display all saved recipes in a list. 
Note that the image and description are conditional fields - they should 
only appear if the recipe has them.
[Attach screenshot or use Figma MCP link]
```

### Step 3: Iterate!
Make it perfect:
- "Add more spacing between recipe cards"
- "Make the recipe cards have a subtle shadow"
- "Show recipes in a grid layout instead of a list"

### üéâ Checkpoint!
Share your result in FigJam!

---

## üîç Stage 8: Make the Search Work

**Concept**: Add interactive functionality

The search bar at the top might already be working, but if it's not, let's fix that!

### Prompt the Agent
```
The search bar isn't working yet. Please make it functional so users 
can search for recipes by name. The search should filter the recipes 
list in real-time as the user types.
```

### Test It!
1. Add a few different recipes
2. Try searching for them by name
3. Iterate if needed:
   - "Make the search case-insensitive"
   - "Also search in recipe categories, not just names"

### üéâ Checkpoint!
Share your results in FigJam!

## ‚≠ê Stage 9: Build Your Own Feature!

**Concept**: Get creative and add something unique

Now it's your turn to be creative! Choose a feature and implement it yourself:

### Feature Ideas

1. **Recipe Price**: Add a price field to track how much recipes cost to make
2. **Recipe Editing**: Allow users to edit existing recipes
3. **Drag and Drop**: Let users reorder recipes by dragging them
4. **Tags**: Add tags to recipes (e.g., "quick", "healthy", "dessert")
5. **Filtering**: Add buttons to filter recipes by category
6. **Favorites**: Let users mark favorite recipes with a star
7. **Cooking Time**: Add fields for prep time and cooking time
8. **Ingredients List**: Add a section to list ingredients

### How to Approach It
1. Describe what you want in plain English
2. Let the AI implement it
3. Test it out
4. Iterate until it works the way you want!

Example prompt:
```
Add a "favorite" feature where users can mark recipes as favorites 
by clicking a star icon. Favorite recipes should show a filled star, 
and non-favorites should show an empty star outline.
```

## üöÄ Stage 10: Deploy Your App to the Web

**Concept**: Make your app accessible to anyone on the internet

Your app currently only runs on your computer. Let's put it on the web!

### Step 1: Ask the Agent
```
How do I deploy this app to the web so anyone can access it? 
I prefer a simple, free solution.
```

### Step 2: Follow the Guide
The AI will likely recommend services like:
- **Netlify** (recommended - very beginner-friendly)
- **Vercel**
- **GitHub Pages**

Follow the step-by-step instructions the AI provides!

### Step 3: Share Your Live App!
Once deployed, you'll get a URL like `your-app.netlify.app` - share it in FigJam! üéâ

## üìñ Afterword

### üéì Congratulations!

You've just built a full application without writing code manually! üéâ

## üí° Principles of Successful AI Coding

### 1. Context is God

The AI can only help you as well as it understands what you're trying to do. The more context you provide, the better results you'll get:

- **Attach relevant files** with `@filename` to show the AI what you're working with
- **Share screenshots** of what you want to achieve - a picture is worth a thousand words
- **Describe not just what you want, but why** - help the AI understand your goals
- **Start new chat** when you want to start a new task

Think of it like explaining your task to a helpful colleague - the clearer you are, the better they can help!

### 2. Iteration is Key

Your first attempt won't be perfect, and **that's completely normal!** Building with AI is a conversation, not a one-shot command:

- Start with a basic version and improve it step by step
- Don't be afraid to ask the AI to try again differently
- Break big tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Test frequently and adjust based on what you see
- Each iteration brings you closer to your vision

Remember: Professional developers iterate constantly too. The difference is that with AI, you can iterate on ideas without getting bogged down in technical details.

### 3. Your Communication Skills Place You Above

Here's the secret: **You don't need to know how to code.** Your ability to explain and describe what you want is what matters:

- **Clear writing skills** help you communicate your vision to the AI
- **Problem-solving abilities** help you break down features and debug issues
- **Understanding the "why"** behind features makes better products
- **Your domain knowledge** (recipes, business rules, user needs) is more valuable than knowing syntax

## üÜö Why Choose Cursor Over Other AI Coding Tools?

There are many AI coding tools out there - Loveable, v0, Bolt, Replit Agent, and more. Here's what makes Cursor special:

### Key Advantages

**Your Files, Your Computer**
Everything saves locally - you own all the code with no vendor lock-in


**Choose Your Stack (if needed)**
Use any technology you want (React, Vue, plain HTML, etc.)

**Control Through Rules**
Customize how the AI behaves (like the `.cursor/rules` you've seen)

**Powerful MCPs**
Connect to tools like Figma, Playwright, GitHub, and more

### When to Use Alternatives

If Cursor feels overwhelming, tools like **Loveable**, **v0**, **Bolt**, or **Replit Agent** are great starting points:

- ‚úÖ Simpler interfaces, less setup
- ‚úÖ Perfect for quick prototypes
- ‚úÖ Faster time to "hello world"

**Think of them as training wheels** - use them to build confidence, then graduate to Cursor when you need more control, want to integrate with other tools, or are building something long-term.
